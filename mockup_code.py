  Please note the following as you adapt this code to your specific needs:
  
  1. Replace the "..." in the 'States' and 'Population' lists of the dataframe with the actual data points from your application context.
  2. Adjust the slider range and default value according to the mock-up image or your requirements.
  3. You might want to adjust the bar plot colors, labels, title, and other properties to better match the mock-up.
  
  This script gives a high-level structure for creating a basic Streamlit app that resembles the provided mock-up. You should further customize this code according to the full details of your application's design and requirements.

    To run the Streamlit app:

    1. Save the given code to a file, e.g., stock_app.py.
    2. Install Streamlit if you haven't already: pip install streamlit.
    3. Run the app with the command: streamlit run stock_app.py.

    Note that this app generates a static table and chart. In a real-world app, you would likely pull the stock data from a database or an API, and the chart and table would be dynamically updated based on the selected stock. Also, for a production app, you would need to handle more edge cases and possibly add more interactivity and features.
